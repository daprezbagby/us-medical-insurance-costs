# us-medical-insurance-costs
## Codecademy Data Scientist Path 4.1.1 U.S. Medical Insurance Costs Portfolio Project
### Project Overview
For this project, you will be investigating a [medical insurance costs dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/mirichoi0218/insurance) in a .csv file using the Python skills that you have developed. This dataset and its parameters will seem familiar if you have done any of the previous Python projects in the data science path.

However, you are now tasked with working with the actual information in the dataset and performing your own independent analysis on real-world data! We will not be providing step-by-step instructions on what to do, but we will provide you with a framework to structure your exploration and analysis.

### Example Project
[Codecademy Example Solution](https://content.codecademy.com/PRO/paths/data-science/python-portfolio-example-solution.zip)

### Project Objectives:
* Work locally on your own computer
* Import a dataset into your program
* Analyze a dataset by building out functions or class methods
* Use libraries to assist in your analysis
* Optional: Document and organize your findings
* Optional: Make predictions about a dataset's features based on your findings

### Prerequisites:
* Python Fundamentals

### Project Expectations
For this project, we expect that you have a basic understanding of Python fundamentals, including how to use functions and/or classes as well as how to work with CSV files. The tasks and project solution code are tailored towards someone with this knowledge base.

If you know Python libraries or skills that extend beyond this expectation (such as NumPy or pandas), you are encouraged to use them. This project is meant for you to show off your knowledge, so do not feel constrained by the tasks or hints written out.
